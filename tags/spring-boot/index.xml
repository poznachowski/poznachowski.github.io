      <description>I really liked the Spring Boot’s concept, since I first saw it. The only thing, I felt, it was missing was a better support for testing in general.
The problem It all started, when I wanted to have a way to test &amp;#39;current date&amp;#39; logic in my application. It was supposed to be a reusable, easy-to-use feature (via an annotation) in a custom Spring Boot Starter. The starter is based on Java 8, hence JSR-310 Date / Time API is a natural pick.</description>

      <description>At Neoteric we have finally decided to move forward with our technology stack. From custom-tailored mix-up of Jetty, Jersey, Guava and Jackson (it all started before Dropwizard came along), going through different versions of these (during our journey we migrated from Jersey 1.x to 2.x, Jackson 1.x to 2.x, Guava 3.0 to 4.0 etc.), we’ve reached to the Spring island and we are currently learning language of the autochthons.</description>
