      <description>I really liked the Spring Boot&amp;#8217;s concept, since I first saw it. The only thing, I felt, it was missing was a better support for testing in general.
 The problem It all started, when I wanted to have a way to test &#39;current date&#39; logic in my application. It was supposed to be a reusable, easy-to-use feature (via an annotation) in a custom Spring Boot Starter. The starter is based on Java 8, hence JSR-310 Date / Time API is a natural pick.</description>
