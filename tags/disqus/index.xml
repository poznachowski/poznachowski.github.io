      <description>I decided to move from Blogger to something, which is more close to a developer&amp;rsquo;s nature - Octopress. Now I can write my blog in my favourite IDE using language I&amp;rsquo;m used to (Markdown). However, my biggest motivation was to change the old layout to something up-to-date. Due to the migration I also expect one more thing to happen - me writing more often. :)
To make this post somehow valuable, I will outline few steps I followed and share links I found useful.</description>
