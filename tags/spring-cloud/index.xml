      <description>At Neoteric we have finally decided to move forward with our technology stack. From custom-tailored mix-up of Jetty, Jersey, Guava and Jackson (it all started before Dropwizard came along), going through different versions of these (during our journey we migrated from Jersey 1.x to 2.x, Jackson 1.x to 2.x, Guava 3.0 to 4.0 etc.), we&amp;#8217;ve reached to the Spring island and we are currently learning language of the autochthons.
 We have picked Spring ecosystem as its most widely known Java solution, with great community support.</description>
